what is Spring Boot?
    --> Spring boot is a project that built on the top of spring framework
    --> provide easier and faster way to setup, configure and run both simple and web application

                                        xml Bean configuration
    Springframework + embedded server - class Configuration     = Spring Boot
                           tomcat          @configuration

Advantages of Spring Boot
    --> create stand alone spring application that can be started using java-jar
        --> extract jar file with all needed from library and plugin and can run it without any
            necessary any thing
    --> test web application easily with the help of embedded http server like tomcat, jetty
    --> there is no requirement for xml configuration because spring boot use annotation
    --> it offers number of plugins --> have many plugin can be use it through POM maven file
    --> provide group of starters declared on pom file this starter like a parent for dependencies
        ex.     spring-boot-starter-parent
                spring-boot-starter-data-jdbc
    --> provide production-ready feature such as metrics, and health check
    --> provide CLI tool for developing and testing spring application
    --> it increase productivity and reduce development time
Limitation of Spring Boot
    --> Spring boot can use dependancy that are not going to be used in the application
        this increase size of application
