Spring Application Runner
    --> Spring Boot provide two interfaces CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner to run a spacific
        pieces of code after application fully started by called run function

        --> Differance between CommandLineRunner and ApplicationRunner
            --> CommandLineRunner -> run function take parameter as a list of string
            --> ApplicationRunner -> run function take a parameter as a applicationArguments object
            --> if we use two classes
                run function on ApplicationRunner will run first
